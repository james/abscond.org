It's been 3 months since my last note, in which time I've become Head of Technology for [the 6 digital adult national screening programmes](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-screening/), raised 2 kittens into young adults, [built and run a new art piece](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKbjDwXouYP/), and [got engaged](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17910333894187737/). But that's all very productive and too much to write about. Let's do some recent mundane consumption bits.

Feeling a bit hungover after a day party yesterday in Bristol. Started at 1pm, and was in bed with a cup of tea by 10pm. Probably sensible for someone confused by the fact the kids were drinking [Hooch, which is apparently back from the 90s but different now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooper%27s_Hooch).

Our most recent date night was a rainy one, and there wasn't much on so â€” [inspired by Stephen Bush](https://www.ft.com/content/f8c87f52-ba3e-4d21-b257-5b85fb052d8e) â€” I booked us tickets for Superman at the Imax in Waterloo. I loved it, and I felt more like a teenager that evening than I think I ever did when I was actually a teenager. The movie hit all the right notes for a blockbuster. Good stuff.

After the film we popped into the excellent [The Hole in The Wall](https://g.co/kgs/Pxs29kT) to have a pint, and got pulled into watching the quarter final of the women's Euros, watching England come from behind to win in penalties. Was hooked from that point. I watched the semi finals with Frank and Louis. There's something incredibly liberating about getting to watch football without having all the [school trauma around not being a football boy](https://abscond.org/2020/08/21/violence-conflict-power-sex). Thoughts not entirely about gender, but definitely a bit about gender.

Rina and I went to Jimmy Fairly to get my eye test and replacement glasses. This is my second time with them, and they're just great. You could definitely do cheaper having the test at a Specsavers and buying glasses at Firmoo, but it is such a hassle and hit and miss. For Â£320 I got my eye test and two pairs of glasses I'm confident in, in a nice environment with excellent customer service. There's been a few of what I think as "millennial opticians" pop up, Ace & Tate and Ollie Quinn are two more within 100 meters of the Jimmy Fairly Bristol store, I haven't tried the others, but I suspect it would be similar. I don't know what's fueling them - is it an innovation or venture capital that will enshittify? Optical Industry watchers (ðŸ‘€) please write in.

I have also eaten at [Oyster Shack and Seafood Bar](https://g.co/kgs/miHYrfT) (Skate knobs are a delicious new one to me), [Panda Dim Sum](https://g.co/kgs/xNEbj2x) (good dim sum, less good mains), [7 Floor Malaysia Tea Room](https://maps.app.goo.gl/se1bZ7rf8NEsAECe9) (amazing and cheap rendang), [Chilli Daddy](https://g.co/kgs/ZNKjCwZ) (The summer noodle salad meal is a great new addition), and a homemade summer pudding.

Garden harvests so far have been candy beetroot, tomatoes, figs, kohlrabi, chard, wild strawberries, radishes, lettuce leaves, peas and the first tiny carrot.
