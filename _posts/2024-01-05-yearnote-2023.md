I didn't write a yearnote last year, which is a shame, as it was an eventful year, with being [promoted to Director at dxw](https://www.dxw.com/2022/06/james-darling-is-dxws-new-technical-director/), my [extension being completed](https://www.madewithvolume.com/thornhill-rd) and [finishing Murmuration and running it at 3 festivals](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgcS-yTqx68/). But this one has been a bit calmer, so I have the time to write one. Sorry you just get to hear about the chill years.

## The Job

![Me working](/img/posts/dxw.jpg#align-right)

I started my new job as [Director of Technology](https://www.dxw.com/2022/06/james-darling-is-dxws-new-technical-director/) in August 2022. I was keen to move into a proper leadership role, partly as I think there's a lack of good leaders in the world, and partly my own personal development to see if I could be one. I had spent a lot of my early career lobbing grenades at institutions, and thought it might be my time to be the one catching them.

I'd very roughly describe the first 3 months as getting my feet under the table, the next 3 months planning and making changes, and the 3 months after that settling those changes in. Since then it's been pretty stable and I've been holding fort.

The role has been what I expected and wanted: I have found it challenging, and I've learned a lot. I have grown professionally but also personally: taking on this different role has involved all of the self-reflection, examination of values and building of confidence that I wanted it to.

I'm not sure what 2024 will bring, but I suspect the election will create some work to be done.

## Travel

There were two big trips this year.

This year I made my fourth trip to Burning Man, to take some friends for their bucket list. They were very excited to be going to a festival where there wouldn't be any mud. That didn't work out, but it was fine, perhaps my easiest and even a bit of a boring Burning Man, as we quickly went into sensible mode when the rains came, and then it was perfect weather for a very clearheaded strike.

In February Johanna took me to Japan for my birthday, which was a real bucket list thing to do. I was most excited about the food, and I wasn't disappointed. I loved the trains. I less enjoyed being in an island country with conservative and baroque social etiquettes. Or at least, when I don't know them.

I spent a decent amount of time in Bristol and Thanet, and in December I think I finally understood Berlin when I visited for [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-berlin), so I expect I'll be there more next year.

## Hobbies

I'm not sure if it counts as a hobby, but I've been trying out some fitness things, settling on yoga on [Apple Fitness+](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-fitness-plus/) and basic strength training at [my local gym](https://www.thegymgroup.com/find-a-gym/east-london-gyms/leyton/) using [Fitbod](https://fitbod.app.link/OzcUf4Kpezb). I might write about this.

Work and social life have pushed my hobbies aside this year. I didn't manage to create any new fire art projects this year, the garden was only mildly tended, I didn't write any code, I only wrote one [pretty random blog post](https://abscond.org/2023/08/12/ford-grand-tourneo-connect), and generally didn't make much. I was drawn to transactional service volunteering: I found a surprising amount of joy in working the bars at my friend's events [Bimble Bandada](https://www.bimblebandada.com/) and [Runt of The Litter](https://www.instagram.com/runt_of_thelitter/).

I hope this will change in 2024, I'm copying a friend's theme for 2024: 'Pottering'. Spending more weekends at home, pottering and making.

## Consumption

![Me relaxing at a spa](/img/posts/spa.jpg#align-right)

I've got a bit more comfortable spaffing my discretionary spending on bougie experiences this year. I've been treating myself to gel manicures, going to nice restaurants, and enjoying spa trips. I loved [Vabali](https://www.vabali.de/en/berlin/) and [Haekels House](https://www.haeckels.house/), but my favourite spa was in the [Peppermill Casino in Reno](https://www.peppermillreno.com/spa/) because I am basic.

I've been working my way through my google maps [wishlist](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FJN42mawgywHaLJz6), and growing my [favs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bFapogRZ2hGDJ5kK6). My favourite restaurants this year were [Koya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vhxHA4nQ5QdVzWG66), [Argoe](https://www.instagram.com/argoenewlyn/?hl=en), [Barrafina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/opCMMkMWWm5wRA8Z7), my local Samali [Al Jaziira](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sBjDrqHcLVenNua29), and [Oyster Shack](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CkcKEc6SL62y1tft8). Nothing knocked [Morito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ytkCPj9RpkXWBQre6) from my top spot though.

As I get older, my music discovery continues to shrink. I actually hope to fix this a bit next year with my pottering, and prioritising music festivals over burns. I did, however, really enjoy [Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C01nBm6vV5c), [Tedeschi Trucks Band](https://open.spotify.com/track/4J3p2xFbyFVyn60PGTqAm2?si=c0ce0aa8948e4b53), and [Anna B Savage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_XE_taTKKg).

## Some stats

I took 50 London busses, and made 206 London Underground journeys. I listened to 2,764 unique songs on spotify. I took 1,683 photos or videos. I took over 2.5 million steps, and did 240 hours of exercise. I lifted 65,000 kg of weights.
