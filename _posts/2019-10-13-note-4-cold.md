It’s a good job I didn’t call these weeknotes, seeing as it has somehow been almost a year since [my last one](https://medium.com/@abscond/note-3-holding-pattern-8cdcab52f965).

I’ve had a cold this week, and the weather has been miserable, so I’ve barely left the house. Luckily it’s post autumnal equinox, so I had already set up the Minecraft server for the winter months (I shut it down on the spring equinox). This year we are doing [All The Mods 3 — Remix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-mods-3-remix). It takes up 8 gigabytes of RAM, and only occasionally makes my laptop have a kernel panic. But it has a lot of mods. If you want to join in, get in touch and I’ll give you details.

The support in the minecraft community is very good. I can get immediate answers from the modpack makers or the people hosting the server any time. It’s better than any other software support I can think of.

Although it was good for my physical health to take it easy with video games, it’s not good for my mental health to stay in that long. So on Friday night I went to see The Bug. I only dropped in for 90 minutes, and was hardly in the mood for a proper dance, but it was good to see [The Bug](https://ninjatune.net/artist/the-bug) again after quite a few years. He’s still doing good stuff. The bass was very good. Flowdan seems a lot more adult since I last saw him probably 5 years ago. The venue ([E1](https://www.e1-london.com/)) was alright, but not great, and a 330ml can of Heineken cost £6.

Next time I see The Bug I definitely need to remember to take a hoodie. It’s music that requires a hood.

Last weekend tickets went on sale for this year’s [London Decompression](https://londondecom.org/). I’ve been even more involved in it this year, working on ticketing, membership and volunteering. It’s essentially become a second job. I’m planning on writing a proper blog post about this soon, as it relates to my [membership thoughts](https://medium.com/@abscond/membership-a-prototype-ea822b2683b).

But for now, I’m very pleased that we sold out in 3 days, and none of [my software](https://github.com/james/london-decom-membership) went horribly wrong and is already showing that it was useful.

For the actual day job, I’m working with [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/) and Southwark Council on [Affordable Housing Monitoring](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/innovate/collabrative-project/affordable-housing-monitoring). I’m really excited about this work. There’s an obvious problem, that we think [putting strings into databases](https://medium.com/@abscond/putting-strings-into-databases-and-then-taking-them-back-out-again-ce95c2ad2183) can make a serious impact on. I won’t go into it too much here, but the [discovery report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT128f_3q7of-OJEbyKG4JTfeYw-UTeT8V9ePDyUZlphzJ6aNya2Axpb-BHKSu3KKEhkl9iMegKQsp2/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000&slide=id.g5fd150983d_0_1509) is public.
