* Fun long weekend in Berlin. No photos.
* Productive week at work. FF [published a case study](https://www.ff.studio/projects/sport-england) on what we're doing. They're good at writing words.
* Binged [Nobody Wants This](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81692417) in a single week. The first 20 minutes will make you very confused how such a standard rom-com could have a 94% rotten tomatoes score, but I fell in love quickly.
* I think the main thing is that yes, the characters are normal straight American rom-com characters with the usual character flaws, but somehow the lead relationship is not only romantic but also is... mostly healthy?
* I've been running a local version of [Dan Catt's Kitty Journaling system](https://github.com/revdancatt/basic-kitty-journaling) for the last couple of weeks. I haven't tweaked it yet, just seeing how it feels.
* I've enjoyed it. [Dan's reccomendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9pHpXIrGWM) to answer every question *sincerely* is a really important one. Even if the question has got the wrong end of the stick. Or even if it makes you cringe with its generic enthusiasm.
* I'm not sure if this is good advice for journaling, dealing with LLMs, or just general life advice.
* I think I'm ready to start tweaking Kitty to my own needs. First off I want to try splitting personal and work journaling to see if that's a good idea.
* Two [yak shaves](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) I'm currently resisting: rewriting it in ruby, and moving my todo list away from Apple reminders so I can have an API to feed it.
* In other journaling news, now that I can [iPhone mirror](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/120421) on my laptop, I've been able to use the [Apple Journal](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/journal/id6447391597) app with a real keyboard. It's a decent setup, but maybe that's because it rewards me with mindfulness points in the Health app.
* R and I played [Jaipur](https://amzn.to/3zXURU7) in [Playground](https://playgroundbristol.co.uk/). Pleasing game in a pleasing cafe.
* I am deep in research about what to clad the shed I'm building with my dad in 3 weeks. Cheap pine fence board, redwood shiplap and composite all on the table. Reckons welcome.
