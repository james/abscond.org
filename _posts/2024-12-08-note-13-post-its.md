Sometimes my brain gets so overloaded that simple decisions become too overwhelming and I start crying over what to pack for a weekend away. When this happens I have learnt that it's helpful to empty my brain into post-it notes. This isn't a productivity system. I have no rules. There's no set size of each one. One might be "put on socks" and another might be "write a novel". I just need to get all the thoughts out of my head so I can stop freaking out.

This week started with a table full of post-it notes.

Last weekend I finally went on the [Mail Rail](https://www.postalmuseum.org/visit-us/what-to-expect/mail-rail/) and it was excellent. It would be my top recommendation for any tourist any age visiting London.

After wearing nothing but [Paul Smith Rabbit trainers](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=48b03a8d7cbf7ae6&biw=1023&bih=823&sxsrf=ADLYWILZYaf9ek6a74GeL6_0hckmMMoeiQ:1733700515520&q=white+rabbit+paul+smith+rabbit+trainers&uds=ADvngMjcH0KdF7qGWtwTBrP0nt7dRsscc1eCoGfrPNWcLEFzUIXeexqc3rSlYqr7XE29p0D3wo8tjVzl6ds2HaQpEmG014xZOkS9UZxQLDglGiIj-Wjq63ydawtxGuaZzf9kAxOlS475-UB95TrPm3ME-4TN89UlX7zJPyrNDTnXF4-gOqR-kTs&udm=2&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBlv_aqZmKAxXpXUEAHS1yAF0QxKsJegQIEBAB&ictx=0) from the ages of 18-34, my lifestyle changes meant that I started wearing a wider variety of shoes. I have [Doc Martens](https://www.drmartens.com/uk/en_gb/2976-stitch-crazy-horse-leather-chelsea-boots-dark-brown/p/27486201), [Clarks desert boots](https://www.clarks.com/en-gb/desert-boot/26155480-p), and some [walking boots](https://www.merrell.com/UK/en_GB/moab-3-mid-gore-tex/52469M.html) on their way. Also Paul Smith stopped making the Rabbit trainers.

But I have fallen in love with [Adidas Sambas](https://www.adidas.co.uk/samba) because they are a) the current uniform for people like me and b) essentially the same as the Rabbit trainers I used to wear.

For a classic staple, you would think they would have a simple and clearly documented product offering. They come in some different colours which is clear enough. And they seem nice and androgynous to me.

However, there are women's and men's. I dislike this on a societal level, but even more on an administrative one. What's the difference between the men's and women's? Is it just the colours? (Inevitably I prefer all the women's colours). The website doesn't say. I spend an hour visiting every shoe shop in Bristol shopping quarter, and get different responses from each sales rep. The women's ones max out at size 7. Or 9. Or 12. The men's are bigger than the same size women's. Or smaller. Or wider.

I met maybe 100 different Sambas that day, but not a single one that I liked and fit on my feet. I think adidas want me to have another little breakdown.

We went to see [Confidence Man in Bristol](https://bristolbeacon.org/whats-on/confidence-man/). It was a very fun and slick show.

You may have noticed that I'm writing notes a bit more frequently. Not *quite* weeklyâ€”I wouldn't be that bold. But more.

This has given me the confidence to see if maybe some people wanted to subscribe to this blog via email, given lots of people don't know what RSS is any more. [You can do that here](https://buttondown.com/abscond). Might delete later.

When I complete a post-it note, I scrunch it up as a present to myself. I tend to scrunch up about a third of them on the day that I write them, a third over the next week, and a third get forgotten about.
