Throughout my 30s I have increasingly got a sore back. A couple of weeks ago it hit my sciatic nerve and I spent the next 3 days trying to find comfortable ways to lie in bed.

A visit to the physio has given me the damning diagnosis of having a weak core. I now have to lie on my front and wave my arms around every day to improve my muscles, and maybe also my character.

I've started a new contract working on [NHS Screening](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/population-screening-programmes-document-collection). It's my first time working in the NHS, and so far the IT and bureaucracy is just as bad as you've heard, but the purpose and the people are just as good as you've heard. Doctors make my kind of Subject Matter Expert: smart, passionate and willing to learn whatever it is they need to do to get the job done.

For Easter, Rina and I drove to Cornwall to [MPV-camp](https://abscond.org/2023/08/12/ford-grand-tourneo-connect) for a couple of nights in Bodmin, before continuing on to see my parents in Newlyn.

We've added a side-awning to the setup, which enables us to have some kitchen and storage space. This is helpful now we're going proper camping and I'm not just using the van as a place to pass out in at festivals. It was extra helpful seeing as it was pouring with rain for the first day.

The rain and mist goes with Bodmin through: it's a very witchy place.

We went to [Berut Bistro](https://www.berut.co.uk/), a BYO Lebanese restuarant. It was delicious, friendly and relaxed, could not recommend it hard enough if, for some peculiar reason, you are in Marylebone.

I finally visited [Moro](https://moro.co.uk/restaurant/history/), the OG for my favourite Morito. It was really nice, but a big plate won't beat some small plates for this millennial.

Post pub Friday fish and chips from [Michael's](https://www.leytonstoner.london/2024/08/23/michaels-on-hainault-road-61-of-readers-say-areas-best-fish-chips/) were superb.

I tried [Yolk](https://www.yolklondon.com/) for a lunch. Somehow more expensive than [Farmer J](https://www.farmerj.com/), but nowhere near as good.

Today was mostly spent weeding the vigorous growth of spring. We ate our first produce of the season: a single radish each.
