3 weeks ago I was busy building a workshop with my dad. It inevitably took more time and brainspace than anticipated. It is still not finished. But I had to stop as I had run out of dad time, I needed to get back to my life, and I needed a break. Of course I made a timelapse. Here it is:

In August I did a casual 3 day bikepack around Kent with a couple fo friends. This made me finally confront the fact that the bike I got from [Tom](https://www.tomtaylor.co.uk/) 8 years ago is too small for me. So after a bit of gumtree trawling, I found another [Reynolds 531](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_531) frame. I've gone from a 55cm frame to a 60cm frame. I should have done this ages ago. I can now look over my shoulder without biomecanically veering in that direction.

Anyway, last week I passed Tom's bike onto Helen, so very pleasingly it will stay within the [BRIG](https://berglondon.com/blog/2013/03/27/regenerations/) family.

We've had a splurry of nice activities to celebrate Rina's birthday. We visited [The Imaginary Institution of India](https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2024/event/the-imaginary-institution-of-india-art-1975-1998) at the Barbican. Despite being handed a literal book to read as you enter, it ended up being a varied but very well constructed and interesting exhibition. The fact that something called The Emergency existed in the real world and not science fiction is a good opener.

We visited [Dongnae](https://www.dongnae.co.uk/#), and we feasted on expertly fermented, grilled and stewed delights. I'll be front of line when they inevitably bottle and sell their gochugang and other sauces. It felt intentional that the restuarant was lit like a stadium, but that reason wasn't offered to us.

I rented the tiny cinema at [20th Century Flicks](https://20thcenturyflicks.co.uk/cinemas) to introduce Rina to [Diva](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1005973-diva). Fortunately she liked it, and it remains my favourite movie. The main thing that changed in this watching for me was thinking how young Jules is.

And finally we ran away for a quiet few days at [The Piggery](https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/devon/southcombe-barn/southcombe-piggery) in Dartmore. All incredibly cute and idylic. I'm not the biggest fan of Devon as a vibe, but driving through the Ambrosia hills is stunning, and even better when viewed from a sauna after an [8 mile(!) ramble](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1963004033?share_token=a4IQUB0MZ01FjxggSC76EXzylbuFeix4iv9KJcsKH9ReSCjJGK&ref=wtd) through the forests and over the tors.

We tried to leave this morning, but the hills are snowed, and the roads are iced. Therefore I am writing this.

In other nice things:
* [Runt Of The Litter](https://www.instagram.com/runt_of_thelitter/) returned, and I attended as a punter this time, not doing a single bit of voluntering. Always a big fan, but I don't think I want to see a waterboarding again any time soon.
* Rina took me to watch [The Outrun](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_outrun) at the Hackney Picturehouse. It is a beautiful, real and delicate movie.
* We watched [A Man Called Otto](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_man_called_otto) on Netflix which is more cheesy, but successfully made me tear up.
* We watched [Fingernails](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fingernails). Disliked everything about it.
