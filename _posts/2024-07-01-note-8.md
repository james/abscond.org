# Note June 28th

Last week was a hot and busy week.

- Some lovely catchups with Clare, Pip, Nick and Frank at [Andu Ethiopian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WC5VHyyi2yjCccDq8), [Baguette King](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NjjffnCmzbcQjTZd8)/Southwark Park and [North Star](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7atiuayfjdbUXt58).
- Day trip to [Brighton Ruby](https://brightonruby.com/), which was as lovely as ever.
    - [Nadia](https://nadiaodunayo.com/) and [Nicky](https://www.knotnicky.com/about/) opened with energy, good vibes and helpful thoughts
    - I learnt enough about [Ractors](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/ractor_md.html) to know that if I’m using them I’m too far down the stack
    - I know [Simon](https://simonwillison.net/) loves SQLite and is probably right, but [litestack](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack) looks like it makes it a serious possibility for me on my next project (if there is one)
    - Maybe I’d use Minitest too? Is it finally time to give up on the rspec and Cucumber dream
    - "Java is for Platonists, Ruby is for Aristotelians”  a talk about comparing programming languages and philosophy - is catnip to me
    - Frontend development in Rails continues to be a mess, and although I love the premise of [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), it just feels like it hasn’t landed, it doesn’t look likely that it will, and I still can’t diagnose why
- ![Photo of me at party](/img/posts/me_party.png#align-right) I spent 24 hours in Bristol for a birthday party
- I sped back to London to see [At The Rainbow’s End](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/at-the-rainbow-s-end#/)
    - TLDR: if you know someone who is LGBTQ+ going into Adult Social Care, it’s probably better they go back into the closet for their own safety
    - That isn't a great thing thing to say, but I think it should be said a) for people’s safety right now and b) to draw attention to that fact
    - Weirdly I had never been to The Courtyard Theatre before. It’s a nice little space.
    - I was late so jumped into a black cab, and the 60 yr old Shoreditch born driver was lovely in every way. We mostly spoke about [Lock Keeper’s cottage](https://tvstudiohistory.co.uk/independent-tv-studios/lock-keepers-cottages-bow/), but also about the play I was seeing and how much he loved his new electric cab. I’m mentioning this because it was a surprise.
- I’m not at Glastonbury or [Nowhere](https://www.goingnowhere.org/) this year, but I am still in various crew whatsapp groups from previous years, so I can live it vicariously ![Screenshot of whatsapp](/img/posts/festival-whatsapp.png#align-center)
- I watched the first series of [Utupia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3163562/). I’d describe it as The Thick Of It but focussing on the civil servants than the politicians. It’s more painfully accurate than funny.
- I’m working a 2-3 days/week contract with [FF Studio](https://ff.studio/). They have an office in the Biscuit Factory. I love working in a studio with friends. Southwark Park is nice. DM me for lunches.
