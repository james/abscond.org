  Great article James.  Love it.  I worked for Lloyd's Register for a year
  forming the digital and data team.  They effectively accredit large ships to
  be fit to sail.  Got me into the world of Regulatory Technology for a bit.  A
  world waiting for a digital revolution. Look forward to more departments in
  your review.
